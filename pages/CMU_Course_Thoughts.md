title: CMU Course Musings

<!---Taking inspiration from Max Slater's blog and Wan Shen Lim's blog, these are my thoughts 
about the courses I have taken at CMU so far. --->

**Goals:** Major in Logic & Computation with an additional major in either Math or CS.
Still unsure about entering the industry or pursuing grad school (not like I have to 
decide anytime soon).

**Background:** Entered CMU with a limited programming background (took AP CSA 
but decided to forfeit credit to retake 15-112) and an uninspiring math background 
(a little competitive math experience, had only taken Multivariable Calculus beyond BC Calc).

"☆" for **outstanding** courses that were the highlight of my semester and were worth attending 
CMU to get to experience. Courses without a star are still worthwhile unless otherwise stated. 

Semester difficulty ratings: {light, medium, heavy, death} corresponding to {lots of free time, 
routine, strict routine and some all nighters, regular all nighters}. I generally aim for 
medium to heavy semesters. (COPIED)

### Fall 2020:

- ☆ 21-128: Mathematical Concepts and Proofs
    - Professor Mackey teaches an amazing discrete math class: highly informative, extremely useful 
        content for many future endeavors in Math and Computer Science
    - Was a pretty challenging class for me since I had not taken a Discrete Math class before
      and had virtually no experience with a rigorous proof-based class.
    - Despite being by far the hardest of my 5 classes (until 112 TP caught up), this was 
        also by far the most rewarding. Mackey left me enthralled and captivated by the beauty of mathematics 
        by the time the end of each lecture rolled around. This class single handedly assuaged any sort of 
        lingering doubts I still had about choosing to come to CMU.
    - Note to people not in MCS or SCS: You can enroll in this course, the honors version of 21-127, 
        by bugging Jason Howell over the summer. IMO it's totally worth doing. Taking 21-128 was easily 
        the highlight of my semester schedule, and I don't regret taking on the challenge.
- 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science
    - Wish I had Kosbie. My professor (Taylor) was incredibly arid and dull in his lectures. 
    Great guy, but his teaching was not engaging at all
    - As a student it seemed to be a very well run class (though I was under the constant impression of TA’s being overworked)
    - Somewhat regret forfeiting my AP CS credit to take this instead of jumping 
    straight to 122, it was a useful class but not necessarily useful enough to justify missing out on 15-251 in my freshman spring.
- 80-211: Logic and Mathematical Inquiry
    - An interesting small class of less than 10 people
    - 40% of the class consisted of a pretty similar overlap with 21-128 content.
    - 30% of the class was an interesting exploration of Interactive Theorem Proving
        and Formal Methods using the Lean programming language. 
    - 30% was devoted to exploring miscellaneous topics in Math and Mathematical Logic.
    - Overall an interesting class, but I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you're
        required to or are trying to knock out a gened. There wasn't enough unique 
        content in this class to differentiate it from Concepts. 
    - This class favors breadth over depth; you're better off taking an individual 
        class on Theorem Proving, or on Mathematical Logic, or on Discrete Math. 
        The class spreads across too many areas without going deep enough in any of it.
- 79-316: Photography, the First 100 Years, 1839-1939
    - Meets once a week for a few hours; most weeks have very little work due, with a project or essay being due every 3 or 4 weeks.
    - Used to fulfill a gened requirement ("Creating" category for Dietrich)
    - Was boring for the most part, but minimal work and probably worth it if it knocks
        out a gened requirement. 
- 76-106/76-107: Writing about Data and Writing about Art
    - By far my least favorite classes of my freshman spring. Interp is unfortunately required for 
        all CMU students, but I found these mini's in particular to be incredibly boring and almost 
        painful to get through, partially because I really do despise writing academic essays about 
        subjects I do not particularly care for. I genuinely despised the class.

**Overall Workload:** Mostly within the medium or light range, with some dips into heavy because of Concepts or procrastinating on essays or the 15-112 Term Project.

**Notes:** COVID made this semester feel very strange. More thoughts on this later. 

### Spring 2021:

- 15-150: Principles of Functional Programming
    - Functional programming was a very interesting and refreshing paradigm to 
        think about as opposed to the standard imperative computaiton of modern
        languages. 
    - Good class overall, Professor Erdmann was very lively to watch. 
- 15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation
    - Introductory data structures and algorithms class.
    - Builds important foundation for all future CS endeavours. 
- 21-241: Matrices and Linear Transformations
    - A.K.A. an introductory class to Linear Algebra
    - More thoughts to come.
- 79-104
    - Required freshman history class for all Dietrich students
    - Pretty easy class overall, only complaint was the essays that we had to write. 
- 66-122: First-Year Seminar: Palestinian and Israeli Food Cultures
    - Fulfills freshman seminar class requirement for Dietrich students. 
    - The topic at hand was actually interesting, revolving around the conflicts going on in the Middle East between Palestine and Israeli, but the course itself was taught in an extremely boring and dry manner. 
    - Overall minimal work. 

**Overall Workload:** TBD

**Notes:** Despite being on campus, remote classes were still a huge struggle to pay attention to;
I found myself spacing out watching 150 lectures, despite the fact that they were actually engaging. 
Zoom university does take its toll when you stare at a computer all day. 

**Summer 2021:**

To be determined...

**Fall 2021:** (Planned)

- Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science (15-251)
- Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms (15-210)
- Algebraic Structures (21-373)
- Formal Logic (80-310)

**Overall Workload: TBD**

**Notes: TBD**
